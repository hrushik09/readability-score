# Readability Score

This program will estimate the level of difficulty of a given text and for which age it is most suitable.

# Description

The program will read a file containing text to be evaluated (filename is passed through command line arguments) and output the score and approximate age needed to comprehend the text.

You can look at different ages corresponding to the different scores by the table in [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index) article.

The algorithms used to determine scores are as follows:
1. [Automated readability index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index)
2. [Flesch–Kincaid readability tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests)
3. [SMOG index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOG)
4. [Coleman–Liau index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index)

This program is based on the Readability Score project on [Jet Brains Academy](https://hyperskill.org).
